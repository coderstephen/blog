I'm a software engineer based in Wisconsin, United States. I currently work at [Widen Enterprises](https://www.widen.com) building large-scale, distributed SaaS applications for a living. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science earned from the [University of Wisconsin-Whitewater](https://uww.edu) in the spring of 2016.

As a knowledge addict, I am never satisfied with my current knowledge level and I'm always working on learning something new. Currently I have expertise in web design and development, shell scripting, networking, code architecture, text encodings, multithreading and concurrency, and asynchronous I/O. I mostly write code in Rust, Java, C#, C/C++, and JavaScript.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal and open source projects, playing video games, playing music, and reading. Occasionally I post articles here that range from short thoughts on life to results of some technical research or discovery I've done.
